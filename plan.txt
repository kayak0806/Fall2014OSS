Order of Operations

Make a boat (it's name is Bert)
    Bert doesn't run any functions yet
    They ask for an initial mainsail setting
    and grab the coeficients from pickle
    TESTED (insofar as you can test an init function)
Make a wind thing
    It's really just a tuple, but it's forced to be 90-270
    ie. from top to bottom counterclockwise
    TESTED (wind_test)
Set boat sail angle
    only works if it's between 0 and 90
    TESTED (really? you wanted me to test this?)
Calculate the angle of attack of the wind on the sail
    It's the angle b/w the wind and the sail
    Tricky part: the wind is measured from east
    but the sail is measured from south
    but what matters is diff b/w wind and -sail
    TESTED (merp :)
Get the lift and drag coeficients for the sails
    Coeficients are saved as a dictionary with the 
    angle of attack (alpha) as the key and the lift
    and drag coeficient pairs as values.
    If the  function returns the value pair with the alpha
    closest to the one given, unless alpha is out of range
    in which case it returns 0.
    TESTED (that was easy)
Get the lift and drag coeficients for the keel
    Coeficients are saved as a dictionary with the 
    angle of attack (alpha) as the key and the lift
    and drag coeficient pairs as values.
    If the  function returns the value pair with the alpha
    closest to the one given, unless alpha is out of range
    in which case it returns 0.
    TESTED (that was easy)
Calculate the lift and drag caused by the sail and keel
Sail Lift:
    Equation for lift is L = 1/2 density (wind velocity)^2 area Cd
    drag should increase with wind magnitude
    lift/alpha should be similar to source coeficient graph,
    peaking just before 10degrees
Sail Drag:
    Equation for lift is D = 1/2 density (wind velocity)^2 area Cl
    drag should increase with wind magnitude
    drag/alpha should be similar to source coeficient graph,
    dips just before 5degrees
Keel Lift:
    Same as sail stuff, peaks around 8 degrees
Keel Drag:
    Same as sail stuff, wide dip around 0 degrees 
Calculate the angle of the boat
    The boat doesn't point exactly in the direction it's moving
    b/c in order for the keel to be useful, it must be at a slight
    angle to the incoming water stream.
    This angle will automatically be chosen to balance out the 
    forces of the keel and sails so that the boat doesn't 
    drift sidways in the water.
