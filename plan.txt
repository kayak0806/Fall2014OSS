Order of Operations

Make a boat (it's name is Bert)
	Bert doesn't run any functions yet
	They ask for an initial mainsail setting
	and grab the coeficients from pickle
	TESTED (insofar as you can test an init function)
Make a wind thing
	It's really just a tuple, but it's forced to be 90-270
	ie. from top to bottom counterclockwise
	TESTED (wind_test)
Set boat sail angle
	only works if it's between 0 and 90
	TESTED (really? you wanted me to test this?)
Calculate the angle of attack of the wind on the sail
	It's the angle betM the wind and the saile
	Tricky part: the wind is measured from east
	but the sail is measured from south
	TESTED (good thing, too)
Calculate the lift and drag caused by the sail and keel
Sail Lift:
Sail Drag:
Keel Lift:
Keel Drag:
Calculate the angle of the boat
	The boat doesn't point exactly in the direction it's moving
	In order for the keel to be useful, it must be at a slight
	angle to the incoming water stream.
	This angle will automatically be chosen to balance out the 
	forces of the keel and sails so that the boat doesn't 
	spin in the water.
